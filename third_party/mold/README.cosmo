DESCRIPTION

  Mold: A Modern Linker ðŸ¦ 

  mold is a faster drop-in replacement for existing Unix linkers.
  It is several times quicker than the LLVM lld linker, the second-fastest open-source linker,
  which I initially developed a few years ago. mold aims to enhance developer productivity by minimizing build time,
  particularly in rapid debug-edit-rebuild cycles.
